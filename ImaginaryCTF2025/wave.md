## Walkthrough
My initial process for forensics challenges is to look at the metadata of the attached file. Different commands for this include file, stat and exiftool. In this instance **exiftool** proved to help obtain the flag.

More on **exiftool** and installation instructions for Kali Linux can be found [here](https://www.kali.org/tools/libimage-exiftool-perl/#exiftool).

Running the command `exiftool wave.wav` on the downloaded file returns file metadata including file type, permissions, etc. Looking closer we can see the flag is in the **Comment** field.
