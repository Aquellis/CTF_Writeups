## Challenge Description
The signpost knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't.

Please find the coordinates (lat, long) of this signpost to the nearest 3 decimals, separated by a comma with no space. Example flag: ictf{-12.345,6.789}

## Walkthrough
I always start these location finding challenges by using Google Lens (search by image) as a starting point. Use the search results to start narrowing down where the picture was taken.

The first (at time of writing) search result included the same sign and pointed to a site about the Sister cities of San Francisco. The webpage appears to tell where this sign is located.

Now using the information we've gathered so far, heading to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) will give us the coordinates.

Open and zoom in on the satellite view of the HP/MS location found and you can see a peculiar shadow which should look similar to the attached picture.

Place a pin on the sign and round the coordinates to three decimal places. Be sure to follow the example flag syntax!

Challenge solved! :sunglasses:
